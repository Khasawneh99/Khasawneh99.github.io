For this project we had to create a comprehensive personal portfolio website to showcase my education background, professional experience, skills and significant projects and certificates. The primary objects were to create an online presence that highlights my qualifications and achievements, and to gain hands-on experience in front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The outcomes and lessons I learned wer Front_end Development, JavaScript Intergration, and Project managment. Overall, this assignment provided a solid foundation in web development and enhanced my ability to present my professional profile online. It also underscored the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the field of technology.
